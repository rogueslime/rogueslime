<h1>Howdy and nice to meet you!</h1>

My name is Tray; I'm a graduate from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a bachelor's in Computer Science: Software Systems. I love software design and development and am always trying to expand my book of spells (or coding skillset if we're being technical)!
